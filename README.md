These are some of my configuration files for terminal Vim and the Mutt email client. Account-specific information about mutt is stored elsewhere, so this is mainly just the formatting stuff, keybindings, and assorted settings. Not all of my vim bundles (e.g., `fugitive.vim`) are included in this repository.

I use `dotfilemanager.py` (available on [Github](http://github.com/seanh/dotfilemanager) to create symlinks of these configuration files into my home directory.
